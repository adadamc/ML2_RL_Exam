# Utilizing Q-Learning in Gymnasium: Step by Step

## Brief Gymnasium Overview
[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) is a useful Python library based on [OpenAI's Gym library](https://github.com/openai/gym?tab=readme-ov-file). This library provides a variety of environments for training and testing reinforcement learning algorithms. You control an agent by choosing from different actions, influencing what state the agent ends up in next. Each environment in Gymnasium provides a non-zero reward (negative or positive) after each step and/or upon reaching the desired end goal. These rewards help reinforcement learning algorithms determine the effectiveness of actions taken in a given state, allowing adjustments in future episodes to determine the best possible action for each state. The environments offer various options that can increase the complexity of finding optimal solutions.
